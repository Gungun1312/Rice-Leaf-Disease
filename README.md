## Introduction
Rice is a staple food for a large part of the world's population. Detecting diseases in rice leaves at an early stage can help in taking preventive measures to ensure healthy crop yield. This project leverages machine learning to detect and classify various diseases in rice leaves.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of rice leaves affected by different diseases. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. You can download the dataset from [this link](#).

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rice-Leaf-Disease.git
cd Rice-Leaf-Disease
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the pre-trained model for disease detection, run the following command:

```bash
python detect_disease.py --image_path path_to_image
```

## Model Training
If you want to train the model from scratch, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the dataset in the correct format.
2. Run the training script:

```bash
python train_model.py --dataset_path path_to_dataset
```

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. Below are some sample results:

| Image | Predicted Disease | Confidence |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| ![Sample1](path_to_sample1) | Disease A | 95% |
| ![Sample2](path_to_sample2) | Disease B | 90% |
